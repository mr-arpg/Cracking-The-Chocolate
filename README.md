# Chocolate Series üç´

It's a weird coincidence, but I keep finding myself working on chocolate-related projects! I guess it's the universe trying to tell me that chocolate is the best way to get people excited about science üòé
Below, some ideas:

## Measuring Light Velocity with Chocolate  
In this experiment, I measured the speed of light using chocolate! You can watch a detailed explanation in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrcOSE6kXLQ).

## Printing a DVD Grating onto Chocolate  
Using the **TPC_Nano_4** (PDF: [TPC_Nano_4.pdf](./TPC_Nano_4.pdf)), I printed a DVD grating onto a piece of chocolate, creating a rainbow diffraction effect. Here's how I achieved it:

1. **Preparation**: Carefully etched the DVD grating into a melted chocolate.  
2. **Experiment Setup**: Used a laser to diffract light through the chocolate, showcasing the resulting patterns.

### Outcome  
This process beautifully demonstrated the diffraction phenomenon, adding a creative twist to scientific experiments.
